So I googled two words:  Flam and rash. And what did I find?  Beauty product message boards, pages and pages of complaints, warnings, rashes.  So I did a little more digging.  Flam has been broke for years.  You've kept your lifestyle up and the company afloat with the money you were skimming from Harlan.  And you would have been fine with the inheritance.

      <Text>Grief.  Why is grief the providence of youth? Maybe it's comforting, the thought that when we'll most encounter it we'll have gained some immunity, maybe by projecting that onto our elders we think we can manifest it for ourselves.  I don't know.  But I'd imagine that age deepens all feelings.  Including grief.  This was a long walk to offering condolences again for the loss of your son. And asking you if it isn't presumptuous of me to not think too harshly of your family, if I am as I suspect the first to console you.  They're young aren't they.</Text>

      <Text>One thing I do assume of age is weariness.  And maybe that's just another version of the cotton gauze projection.  But even with the years I have, damned if I don't get more tired every day.  Tired of what I do. Following arcs, like lobbed rocks. The inevitability of truth  - lord how grand - sounds like a rosy eyed optimism, maybe. I do believe it. But the complexity and the gray lies not in the truth but what you do with the truth once you have it.</Text>
